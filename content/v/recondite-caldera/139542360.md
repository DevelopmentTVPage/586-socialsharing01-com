    "description": "We seem to be unable to help ourselves. Recondite has become the artist that we've featured the most on our channel and today we're adding another track to that already impressive list. Why bother, you ask? Because we feel you need to hear this one as well.\n\nHis 'Caldera' EP seems to be a statement of his artistic progress since bursting onto the scene with 'DRGN'. The b-side on 'Caldera' is fittingly called 'DRGN2' and features elements of 'DRGN' (melody) and 'Cleric' (rhythm), yet with some newer elements. It's as if he's saying: \"I'm closing the book on that chapter now, and I'm moving forward with 'Caldera'\". Melodically it's still very mysterious and captivating, yet somehow Caldera is a little bit more accessible.\n\nOn October 16th at ADE, Recondite will be playing in the other room at HYTE Warehouse (hosted by Welcome to the Future). We'll surely be skipping over every once in a while to check him out again. - C.\n\nArtist: Recondite\nTitle: Caldera\nLabel: Hotflush Recordings\nCatalog#: HFT035\nReleasedate: 2014-09-01\n\nBuy: \nhttp:\/\/www.beatport.com\/release\/caldera\/1359553\n\nSocial: \nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ReconditeMusic\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/_recondite_\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/recondite\nhttp:\/\/www.hotflushrecordings.com\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/hotflush\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/HotflushUK\n\nImage: Orlova Maria\nhttp:\/\/www.orlovamaria.com\n\nMotion graphics: Jeisson Drenth\nhttp:\/\/www.jeissondrenth.nl\n\n\nBecome part of the SEKOIA community: \nWebsite: http:\/\/www.sekoia.nl\nFacebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sekoiacom\nTwitter: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/sekoiacom\nSoundcloud: http:\/\/www.soundcloud.com\/sekoiacom\n\nDisclaimer: SEKOIA is a community focussing on taking deep electronic music to a higher level by sharing knowledge and information about these beautiful tracks.
