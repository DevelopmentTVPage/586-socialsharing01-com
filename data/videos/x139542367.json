Inredibly arranged percussions and tribal vibe in this one...the sound goes directly into your blood and kicks off the rhythm in you...very forward pushing sound, that is sure to get you some smiles. It's iinsane how simply the build around the percussions is and a true proof, how critical percussions can be...insane vibe.\n\nEnjoy & Buy!!\n\nWant this video removed?

We are now happy to present 'Rebirth 10 Remixed': a special collection, available on a limited 2x12 vinyl edition, and three digital parts, including brand new versions of some of the classics of the label in the first ten years.\nThe first part includes remixes from Red Axes, Rampa, Modular Project and VVV. The hot Tel Aviv duo Red Axes bring their trademark new wave sound to a tropical dimension remixing Robytek's 'Luna Africana' combining unusual melodies of bells, chimes and perc drums. The Keinemusik boss Rampa is back with a killer remix of 'Deep Musique' by Pasta Boys Feat. Osunlade, definitely another dancefloor peak time cut on Rebirth. The italian duo Modular Project add their electronic-balearic touch to the Blond:ish vocal anthem Wizard of Love, while the misterious bass producer VVV reworks another classic on the label, Crossroads by T-Polar, giving us a sublte but heavy deep and futuristic synth work. \nThe cover sleeve is a work by Emil Schult, who has created a painting especially for the Rebirth's Anniversary. Emil is known for his work with electronic music pioneers Kraftwerk. Schult's collaboration with founders Ralf H\u00fctter and Florian Schneider saw him actively involved in writing lyrics as well as generating the design for some of the band's most famous covers.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad-------------------------\n\n\u25ba Be a Part of our \"Nie Wieder Schlafen\"\/ \"Never Sleep again\" - Community :\n\n\u25cf Our Main Channel : http:\/\/bit.ly\/nws-yt\n\n\u25cf Our 2nd-Channel  : http:\/\/bit.ly\/nws-yt-2nd-channel\n\n\u25cf Facebook : http:\/\/bit.ly\/nws-fb\n\n\u25cf Soundcloud (Nie wieder Schlafen) : http:\/\/bit.ly\/nws-sc\n\n\u25cf Instagram : http:\/\/bit.ly\/nws-instagram\n\n\u25cf Twitter : http:\/\/bit.ly\/nws-tweet\n\n\u25cf Soundcloud (Myself) : http:\/\/bit.ly\/nws-sc-steppi\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad-------------------------\n\n\nVideo only for Promotion of the Artists.\nThe music in this video is copyrighted by their respective owners.\nWe do not own the copyrights for them.
