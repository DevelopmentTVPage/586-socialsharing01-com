    "description": "As my love for oriental-vibes grows bigger & bigger (especially caused by the duo Bedouin), I came across Hraach, an amazingly talented armenian producer based in Valencia. He made some really great slow-burners, that pretty much always work for starting a set nice & smooth! \"Delirio\" might not be in this \"oriental\"-category...but it has a great slow & chill vibe that seems perfect to start the night. Have a great weekend everyone.\n\nEnjoy & Buy!!\n\nWant this video removed?
