    "transcripts": "hi there everyone I'm your host Mikey of\n\n\nthe crochet crowd and you're most likely\n\n\nwatching today's video as you'd like to\n\n\nlearn on how to do some closed\n\n\ncaptioning and become a crochet tier for\n\n\nthe crochet crowd today I'm going to\n\n\nshow you all the steps involved for\n\n\nlearning how to close caption any videos\n\n\non YouTube closed captioning at this\n\n\ntime is not required by law for our\n\n\nparticular tutorials here on YouTube\n\n\nonly videos where all or a portion of a\n\n\nvideo has appeared on US television is\n\n\nrequired to have closed captioning as\n\n\nper the law the crochet crowd is\n\n\nCanadian in origin and is fully\n\n\ncompliant with the caption certification\n\n\nlaws\n\n\nnone of our tutorials have been hosted\n\n\nor shown on USA television or any other\n\n\ncountry television networks in the event\n\n\nthis changes in the future we will be\n\n\nfully compliant with the law to ensure\n\n\nthat videos are 100% closed-captioned\n\n\nprior to release as per the law none of\n\n\nour video tutorials are required to have\n\n\nclosed captioning however in the attempt\n\n\nto be inclusive to all of the crochet\n\n\ncrowd our team plus hundreds of\n\n\nvolunteers just like you have put in\n\n\ntime to correct the voice scripts and\n\n\nwrite new boy scripts so that tutorials\n\n\ncan get a closed captioning box\n\n\ncertification the point of the closed\n\n\ncaptioning is more than just what you\n\n\nwould think with hearing impaired though\n\n\nthere are over 40 million Americans with\n\n\nhearing issues closed captioning also\n\n\nprovides assistance for those who do not\n\n\nwish to have sound while viewing you may\n\n\nnot want to disturb somebody on the\n\n\nsubway as if you're learning or maybe\n\n\nyou just don't want to wake up the house\n\n\nif you're looking at her to chose in the\n\n\nmiddle of the night the closed\n\n\ncaptioning opens door ways of learning\n\n\nno matter what environment you are in so\n\n\nMikey aka myself I only speak in right\n\n\nEnglish while you have the ability to\n\n\ntranslate me to any other language\n\n\nduring this process having me speaking\n\n\nin another language is not possible so\n\n\nlet's move on and have you do some\n\n\nclosed captioning and I'll show you how\n\n\nit's done and I will start from the very\n\n\nbeginning so to begin you need to be\n\n\nlogged in to your YouTube account and\n\n\nmust be on a desktop or laptop computer\n\n\nyou cannot do this process if you're on\n\n\na tablet and iPod or even a mobile\n\n\ndevice so the first question on your\n\n\nmind is how do you identify which videos\n\n\nare already closed captioned we're going\n\n\nto cover that next all videos that have\n\n\nnot been closed captioning are open for\n\n\nyou to do the captioning and it can be\n\n\ndone by anyone to identify which videos\n\n\nhave not been closed captioned\n\n\nvideos that haven't been certified with\n\n\nthe closed captioning will not have the\n\n\nCC box under or beside the video\n\n\ndescription\n\n\nwhile YouTube may produce an automatic\n\n\nscript that is close to the words spoken\n\n\nin the tutorial the CC box certification\n\n\ngives you confidence that real human\n\n\neyes went through the video thoroughly\n\n\nand we also corrected the script at the\n\n\nsame time once you identify a tutorial\n\n\nthat does not have the CC box and you\n\n\nwant to do the script for it you will\n\n\nneed to enter into the editing mode and\n\n\ndon't worry I'm going to show you how to\n\n\ndo that from here so let's take a look\n\n\nat the player window and on the bottom\n\n\nright of the play window you'll see a\n\n\ngear that gear gives you options such as\n\n\nplay speed for a video to play quality\n\n\nand also closed captioning options so\n\n\nwhat I want you to do is click the\n\n\nclosed caption option and a new menu\n\n\nwill appear and there is an option to\n\n\nadd subtitles and closed captioning just\n\n\nsimply click it so a new screen will\n\n\nopen up and you just have to tell it\n\n\nwhich language you were about to type in\n\n\nfor your script for English you would\n\n\njust choose English UK English is not\n\n\nthe same thing and all of our videos are\n\n\njust set for just regular English so\n\n\nscript is based on just English when\n\n\nit's doing the upload if you wish to\n\n\ntranslate the video into a language that\n\n\nis completely different\n\n\njust select the language from the menu\n\n\nand then begin from that point just\n\n\nremember that if you select a different\n\n\nlanguage this automatic script will not\n\n\nchange to that language you'll have to\n\n\nlisten to it in English and then\n\n\ntranslate it to the language that you\n\n\nare about to translate it to once you\n\n\nselect your language a new screen will\n\n\nappear if there are no words appearing\n\n\nin the script you have the Actions menu\n\n\nthat is right above and this menu may\n\n\nnot always have some of the options and\n\n\nit depends on the mood of YouTube and\n\n\nI'll explain more so what I want you to\n\n\ndo is click actions and let's see what's\n\n\nthere if you see auto-generate you can\n\n\nclick that and what's going to happen is\n\n\nthat YouTube will instantly scan through\n\n\nthe tutorial and place the words that\n\n\nare used and put them in to time markers\n\n\nthis is called the automatic script this\n\n\nis what YouTube thinks that I'm saying\n\n\nin a tutorial so the automatic script is\n\n\ndone when the video is uploaded so part\n\n\nupload YouTube spends about 5 minutes to\n\n\n1 hour depending on the length of the\n\n\nvideo to recognize my voice and put a\n\n\nscript that it thinks that I'm saying\n\n\nhowever for reasons that I don't\n\n\nunderstand it's not always automatic in\n\n\nthe event that a YouTube\n\n\ncomputer does not complete the auto\n\n\nscript process we are powerless to have\n\n\nYouTube computers to try again to try to\n\n\ngenerate the script we have found\n\n\nthrough trial and error that re\n\n\nuploading videos doesn't always generate\n\n\na new script so it's not a fail-safe\n\n\nthing for us to do so the videos would\n\n\neither have the guest script that it\n\n\nthinks that I'm saying or we'll have no\n\n\nscript at all and today I'm going to\n\n\ntalk about both options so the script\n\n\nscreen let's talk about what you're\n\n\nlooking at first you will see above the\n\n\nvideo a checkbox for credit my\n\n\ncontribution this is assigning your\n\n\nyoutube name to be the official author\n\n\nof the script this will be visible to\n\n\nthe public it's a way for you to be\n\n\nrecognized for the hard work that you\n\n\napplied to my tutorial so looking below\n\n\nthe video you will have a checkbox for\n\n\nthe pause video while typing so as you\n\n\ntype the video instantly stops and waits\n\n\nfor you and then instantly starts back\n\n\nup as soon as you stop typing this\n\n\nallows you to stay caught up to my voice\n\n\nif the script is in and the time has\n\n\nalready said your job is to go through\n\n\neach script box and correct the spelling\n\n\npunctuation or words for example\n\n\nsometimes I say the number one but it\n\n\nthinks that I could have said one is if\n\n\nI want a prize so you just have to make\n\n\nsure you check the words and make sure\n\n\nit makes sense if the script is not\n\n\nmaking any sense you can just click play\n\n\non the video self in or play what is in\n\n\nthe script box that you're currently\n\n\nediting you hear my voice and type what\n\n\nyou hear you would probably notice by\n\n\nnow is that the automatic script does\n\n\nnot do any sentence structure everything\n\n\nis a run-on sentence and sometimes it\n\n\ngets words like that's or it's but\n\n\nsometimes it doesn't at all so your job\n\n\nis to make sentences with my words your\n\n\njob is to correct the script into a\n\n\nsentence structure to the best of your\n\n\nability just so you know you will not\n\n\nneed to change the timing of my words so\n\n\njust concentrate on the script and make\n\n\nthat your biggest priority as some of\n\n\nyou know I use slang and my own words\n\n\nthat sometimes they're just made up fun\n\n\nwords so what I want you to do is type\n\n\nmy slang and words so that the person\n\n\nwith hearing difficulties can see that\n\n\nI'm being sarcastic funny or having\n\n\ninnuendo this allows them to see through\n\n\nmy words that are not very formal so\n\n\nlet's talk now about drafts and\n\n\nsubmissions so depending on the length\n\n\nof the tutorial you may finish your\n\n\nscript in one sitting or need to come\n\n\nback and finish it later your youtube\n\n\nprofile is automatically saving a draft\n\n\nwe this draft copy is not seen by us\n\n\nhere at the crochet crowd this allows\n\n\nyou to work on the script at your own\n\n\npace without any pressure with us\n\n\nknowing that you're actually working on\n\n\nit also if another person which is\n\n\nhighly unlikely is working on the same\n\n\ntutorial you won't know if somebody else\n\n\nis nor will we in our history this has\n\n\nrarely happened and is something that\n\n\nyou don't need to worry about once you\n\n\nare done you will click Submit your\n\n\ncontribution and we'll come over here to\n\n\nthe crochet crowd into the translations\n\n\nand transcriptions box we don't receive\n\n\nan email that you have just completed\n\n\nyour script and it's something that we\n\n\ncheck every day most likely in the\n\n\nmorning and I will tell you what I do\n\n\nfrom that point a little bit later so in\n\n\na perfect world we hope that YouTube\n\n\ndoes the auto-generated script however\n\n\nfor reasons that I don't know it doesn't\n\n\nalways complete this step and we have no\n\n\nscript at all to assign to a video so\n\n\nlet's talk about that because that's\n\n\nalso an option and something that we do\n\n\nrun into so let's talk about no\n\n\nautomatic script so here we're looking\n\n\nat a tutorial where YouTube has not\n\n\ncompleted the script so there's nothing\n\n\nfor editing as far as going line by line\n\n\nif this happens we don't have the power\n\n\nto ask YouTube to retry it again\n\n\nit either tries one it uploads for the\n\n\nvery first time and if it fails it's\n\n\npretty much game over so at this point\n\n\nwe have four options so option number\n\n\none is that we can upload a file which\n\n\nis the script itself in a written\n\n\nspecial format this is something that we\n\n\nactually don't have the capability to do\n\n\nand this is something that we don't have\n\n\non file because everything that I say is\n\n\nnot scripted so this is not an option in\n\n\nnumber two we can transcribe and\n\n\nauto-sync the script\n\n\nsimply means that you can type what you\n\n\nhear and YouTube was sort of the timings\n\n\nof what you typed later this is the best\n\n\noption of for it and this is the one I\n\n\nrecommend the most number three is that\n\n\nyou can create new subtitles or closed\n\n\ncaptioning it works that you have to set\n\n\nthe timings manually so you have to type\n\n\nwhat you hear and that set the time\n\n\nmarkers accurately to my voice this is\n\n\nextremely time consuming and I don't\n\n\nrecommend this to anyone because it\n\n\ntakes so long so don't consider number\n\n\nthree and finally the fourth option is\n\n\nto buy subtitles or closed captioning\n\n\ntranslations YouTube is connected to\n\n\nseveral services that you pay-as-you-go\n\n\neach service charges by the length of\n\n\nthe tutorial and for our purposes this\n\n\nis a very\n\n\noption so this is something that we will\n\n\nnot entertain so let's circle back and\n\n\nlet's go back to option number two which\n\n\nis the transcribe and auto-sync so let's\n\n\nclick on transcribe and auto-sync\n\n\nand now we are just going to set the\n\n\nlanguage in which you're about to type\n\n\nin a new window will open up and you'll\n\n\nsee just a simple box and you will see a\n\n\nbox says type what is spoken here and\n\n\nyou will notice underneath the box a\n\n\ncheck box to pause the video while\n\n\ntyping so you will start the video by\n\n\nclicking play as soon as you hear my\n\n\nvoice my voice will stop dead when you\n\n\nstart topping and it allows you to type\n\n\nwhat you've heard once you stopped\n\n\nhiding my voice automatically starts\n\n\nback up again and you can push the\n\n\nrewind button to play back about one\n\n\nsecond earlier you can also move the\n\n\nslider on the play ones back me up if\n\n\nthe video played too far ahead for you\n\n\nas well the advantage of this simple box\n\n\nis that you can type exactly what you\n\n\nhear without having to worry about\n\n\nsetting the timings to match my voice\n\n\nyou can either type in the paragraphs or\n\n\njust by sentence by sentence with spaces\n\n\nin between and once you were done the\n\n\nscript you will click set timings once\n\n\nyou've click set timings YouTube will\n\n\ntake about five minutes to one hour to\n\n\nreview your new script it'll match your\n\n\nscript to my voice on its own so if you\n\n\nremember option three creating new\n\n\nsubtitles and closed captioning you\n\n\nwould have had to do all the timings on\n\n\nyour own so it would have been a super\n\n\npain so once all the timings are set the\n\n\nscript is then sent over here to the\n\n\ncrochet crowd for review so let's talk\n\n\nabout the review process so once you've\n\n\nreviewed the script by making your\n\n\nCorrections or having to type an\n\n\nentirely new script that had to be\n\n\nretimed by YouTube it'll appear over on\n\n\nmy dashboard here on the backend of our\n\n\nYouTube channel you should know that I\n\n\nwill not get notified by email by\n\n\nYouTube once you have done this so I'm\n\n\nin the habit of checking every morning\n\n\nif the script has been reviewed and\n\n\nit'll appear on my list with others if\n\n\nfeathers have been done at the same time\n\n\nI will review your script and if I\n\n\napprove it I will click publish and it\n\n\nwill instantly assign the closed\n\n\ncaptioning certification box to the\n\n\nvideo YouTube do not email you back once\n\n\nI clicked approved if the script needs\n\n\nmore work such as that it's only\n\n\npartially done I will click needs more\n\n\nwork and it will go back to your YouTube\n\n\nchannel asking you to make further\n\n\nCorrections if necessary but just for\n\n\nthe record I've not ever had to use that\n\n\noption people who are doing these\n\n\ntutorials for the\n\n\ncurtisha crowd take their commitment\n\n\nseriously and do follow through once I\n\n\nclick publish\n\n\nI will then assign your video to be in\n\n\nthe closed captioning playlist this is\n\n\nhow you will know if your video was\n\n\napproved this gives confidence to those\n\n\nthat requiring the service to have a\n\n\ndedicated section on our YouTube channel\n\n\nthat has the closed captioning done\n\n\npeople can also search our channel and\n\n\nfind the closed captioning certification\n\n\nboxes on any of the videos within our\n\n\nchannel your youtube name\n\n\nif you click credited for the captions\n\n\nwill now appear as a tutorial inside the\n\n\nvideo descriptions itself and it will\n\n\ngive you credit for being the person who\n\n\ncreated and\/or edited the closed\n\n\ncaptioning portion of the video just so\n\n\nyou know this recording was done at the\n\n\nend of April 2017 YouTube is always\n\n\nupgrading and slightly changing\n\n\nprocedures at this time of publication\n\n\nthis was true and accurate to how the\n\n\ncommunity contributions for closed\n\n\ncaptioning works within YouTube should\n\n\nyou wish to participate with our\n\n\nvolunteer program we thank you sincerely\n\n\nfor taking our commitment and your\n\n\ncommitment very seriously to providing\n\n\nfree education not just us that\n\n\nappreciate your effort but also those\n\n\nwho require the service in order to\n\n\nparticipate with our platform until next\n\n\ntime I'm making on behalf of your\n\n\ninspirations as well as the crochet\n\n\ncrowd calm thank you so much for\n\n\nlistening to me today\n\n\nwith you again real soon bye bye\n\n\n[Music]",
